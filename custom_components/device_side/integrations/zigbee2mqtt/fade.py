    Brightness and saturation fades are separate calls, each with its own transition: the bulb runs them
    independently. Predictions live per light and attribute (the core transition cache), so a move after a stop
    continues from where the light halted. A group gets one publish to its group topic, so its members fade together;
    each member's transition is recorded from its own start, and the group's start is the mean of its lit members.

    Raising brightness turns the light on. Lowering it to 0 % is Z2M's soft off, state OFF with the transition, which
    keeps the level for the next plain on. Saturation is written as a color, the light's current hue with the end
    saturation, and moves only lit lights. Hue is Z2M's hue_move, a cycle at a rate the bulb runs until a stop; a
    sweep_time outside 1-254 s is clamped, with clamped_to. A light whose Z2M definition lacks color_hs is unchanged
    with fields_dropped for hue and saturation. A move with nothing left to make is unchanged with at_limit; one with
    only lights that are off to move is unchanged with off.

    Z2M publishes the end value at once. Once a fade has run, its attribute is read back, and a saturation fade's color
    refreshed (color_refresh), so HA ends right even after a live read mid-fade.
